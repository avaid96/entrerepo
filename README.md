##  Entrepreneurship links and resources

Starting a business is hard and the web is filled with resources that can help. However, we couldn't seem to find a good, centralized resource to for entrepreneurial inspiration. So, we decided to start maintaining this repository to be that resource.

I hope you like it and please do contribute. I will do my best to attend to pull requests but to make it quicker, please try to keep styling consistent with the rest of the repo. If the repo gets popular, I'll write a PR guide.
